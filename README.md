# AutoML OPS Platform üöÄ

**End-to-End Machine Learning Automation with MLOps Integration**  
*From raw data to deployed models, powered by Streamlit, Open-Source LLMs, and MLOps best practices.*

---

## üìå Overview

**AutoML OPS Platform** is a comprehensive tool designed to automate and streamline the entire machine learning lifecycle. It empowers users to:  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with automated insights.  
- Clean and transform data using natural language (LLM-powered).  
- Train, compare, and explain models interactively.  
- Track experiments, detect data drift, and deploy models with MLOps integration.  

Ideal for data scientists, ML engineers, and developers looking to accelerate model development while ensuring reproducibility and scalability.
